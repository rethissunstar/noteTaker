 ## Contributors: 
"My tutors dennis itua and scott mcnally tried to help with this but overall I had to use some pretty unconventianal ways to get it working on heroku.  It should also be noted that despite the two they could not get the index.js to work from a script reference nor the css.  As an improvise I have had to include the script and style within notes.html for the functionality to work.  I dare anyone to try and see if they can make it work."
